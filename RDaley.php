			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>I am a senior Digital Media Studies major, and I am interested in digital marketing, design, and content creation. I enjoy laying in bed for extended periods of time, eating expired pastries that I bring home from work, and RuPaul's Drag Race.</p>

				<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p>I was born and raised around Albany, NY specifically the town of Niskayuna.  I played every mainstream sport at least once when I was younger and realized that I lacked hand-eye coordination and sucked at all of them.  I ran track instead through middle to high school.  I hate running now.  I also played the violin for 11 years.  I haven't touched it since I graduated.  I used to be really smart but now I am just mediocre.  I cry about it sometimes.</p>
			

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<h3>On Campus</h3>
					<p>I am the captain of the Bhangra team here on campus, an Indian dance team that competes in competitions nationwide.  I enjoy choreographing and dancing for this team.  I also dance for Rochester Raas, the other Indian dance group.  I am a member of the PRIDE Network, the U of R's LGBT+ community, as well as a brother of Phi Kappa Tau (sometimes haha).  I work at Starbucks as well, and enjoy complaining about making frappucinos and people with complicated orders.</p>
				<h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
					<p>I enjoy playing video games and watching TV.  I play a lot of League of Legends and Overwatch, arguably too much.  I used to play for hours everyday but I've been trying to adult a little bit more and haven't played nearly as much.  My favorite TV show to watch is RuPaul's Drag Race; it's like a Project Runway meets ANTM but for drag queens.  Sometimes I consider being a drag queen, but I would have to shave my beard and beardless is not a good look for me.</p>
